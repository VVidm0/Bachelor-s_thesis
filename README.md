# Analysis of protein-protein interactions in the context of human-bacteria relationships

This repository contains executable code and data necessary for my bachelor's thesis, conducted during the 3rd year of Bioinformatics studies at Jagiellonian University.

---

## Project Goals

- Integrate experimentally confirmed host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from the PHISTO and HPIDB 3.0 databases.
- Process, filter, and unify protein identifiers (UniProtKB).
- Annotate proteins using UniProt JSON data (sequence length, protein name, taxonomy).
- Build an interactive, filterable PPI network visualization in **Dash**.
- Analyze biological context (taxonomy, sequence properties) of interacting proteins.

## Requirements
The easiest way to get access to all of the required python libraries is to use `requirements.yml` for creating new Conda enviroment. 

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate ppi-analysis
```
---

## Dash app
### Running the interactive PPi viewer
Launch the Dash web application to explore the interaction network by providing single command:

```bash
python generate_graph.py [sum|diff|all]
```

- `sum` - highlights PPIs present in PHISTO or HPIDB 3.0, including differences
- `diff` - shows only interactions that differ between the two datasets
- `all` - displays the full merged network of interactions

---

### Features of the Dash App
#### Interactive filters:
    - Minimum node degree (number of interactions)
    - Minimum sequence length (from UniProt JSON)
    - Organism of origin (from FASTA headers)
#### Hover tooltips with:
    - Protein ID(UniProt)
    - Full protein name
    - Sequence length
    - Organism
    - Number of host/pathogen interactions
#### Color-coded edges based on data source:
    - Purple: shared interactions (PHISTO & HPIDB 3.0)
    - Orange: unique to PHISTO
    - Brown: unique to HPIDB 3.0
